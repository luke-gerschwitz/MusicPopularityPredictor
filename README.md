# MusicPopularityPredictor

The Spotify Web API provides various metrics for the songs on its service (i.e. "danceability", "tempo", etc). The "popularity" metric is a value between 0-100 which measures the popularity of a given song. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the "popularity" of a song given all the other song metrics. It will be using the "Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks" dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). This is a dataset containing over 160,000 songs collected from the Spotify Web API.
